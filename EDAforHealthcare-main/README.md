# EDA for Healthcare  

## Overview  
This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of a healthcare dataset to uncover trends and patterns in patient demographics, treatment costs, and outcomes. The goal is to provide actionable insights for healthcare providers to improve decision-making and patient care.  

## Key Features  
- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset.  
- **Statistical Analysis**: Performed descriptive statistics to understand data distribution and correlations.  
- **Data Visualization**: Created interactive visualizations to present key insights, such as:  
  - Trends in patient demographics (age, gender, location).  
  - Correlation between treatment costs and recovery rates.  
  - Identification of high-risk patient groups.  
- **Actionable Insights**: Identified cost-saving opportunities and areas for improving patient outcomes.
